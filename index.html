							<h3>My research story</h3>
							<div class="flex flex-2">
								<div class="6u">
									<p>In my PhD, I have been focusing on how can we use multimission satellite data in advancing operational water management practices. We all know that effective water management depends on three key components: monitoring, forecasting and quantification of human impacts. Understanding of complex hydrological processes and the real-time availability of large amount of data are prerequisites for monitoring and prediction of water resources. Although ground-based measurement is the best way to monitor, it is impossible to measure all of the relevant geophysical variables with the required spatio-temporal scale. As a complementary source, satellite remote sensing has proven its application potential during the last decade. In my research, I have shown that observation capability of a single satellite can be enhanced by using the compound eye view afforded by multiple satellites. A combination of multi-mission platforms, numerical modeling and advances in computational resources facilitate the way of better water management. My overarching goal is to provide a proof-of-concept of mainstreaming the application of multi-satellite observation based water management in data-limited regions.</p>

									<h3>River Monitoring</h2>
									<p>In the monitoring component of my PhD research, a method was proposed to improve river height from the altimeter satellite. Here, river morphology information from ancillary satellites (Landsat and Sentinel 1-SAR) was extracted and then applied to get the altimeter height based on derived morphology. The accuracy of the method was tested over river locations with diverse hydraulic characteristics. It was found that the river-morphology based method can improve conventional altimter height estimation method in dynamically changing rivers.</p>

									<h3>Flood Forecasting</h3>
									<p>As an application of satellite observations in forecasting component of water management, numerical weather prediction (NWP) model outputs in extreme event forecasting was studied. Nowcast and forecast meteorological parameters and land-surface variables were forced in a hydrologic-hydrodynamic framework to generate skillful forecasts for up to 5 days. The method was globally scalable and economically feasible for developing nations.</p>

									<h3>Human Impact Quantification</h3>
									<p>The third component of water management – quantification of human impacts was studied in this chapter. A global reservoir monitoring framework was built to investigate the impact of existing and proposed dams. A satellite data-based mass balance approach was used to quantify reservoir outflow. In the last (fourth) chapter, this framework will be used to study the impact of existing reservoirs as well as to optimize the benefits of future dams/reservoirs.</p>

									<h3>Operational Models and Frameworks</h3>
								</header>
								<p>I have been involved in developemnt of a number of operational and automated systems and web based framework for enhancing application of remote sensing in operational water management, flood forecasting and reservoir monitoring. Some selected operational systems directly related to my ongoing research are shown below. For a full list of frameworks I built, users are suggested to go to the following link.<br><b><a href="http://depts.washington.edu/saswe/" class="link">Link to the operational systems of SASWE Research Group</a></b></p>

									<p><a href="http://depts.washington.edu/saswe/rat_beta/" class="link"><span class="image left"><img src="images/rat.jpg" alt="" /></span></a>The Reservoir Assessment Tool (RAT) represents a global and freely accessible system to monitor the operating pattern of world’s current and planned reservoirs and their impact on water availability. RAT is designed to address limitations faced by downstream stakeholders in developing regions of limited access to measurement data and upstream opaque transboundary reservoir policy. It is based on the core SASWE principle that ‘access to information on water is a fundamental right for all humans and nations.’ The development of RAT is always on-going. The developers do not accept any responsibility for wrongful application or faulty decision making based on RAT outputs.<br><b><a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2020/02/13/hydropower-dams-cool-rivers-in-the-mekong-river-basin-satellites-show/" class="link">Relevant UW News Link</a><br><a href="http://depts.washington.edu/saswe/rat_beta/" class="link">Reservoir Assessment Tool Beta version website</a></b></p>

									<p><span class="image right"><a href="http://depts.washington.edu/saswe/flashflood/" class="link"><img src="images/flashflood.PNG" alt="" /></span></a>This system was developed for a stakeholder nations asa an example. The flashflood and early warning system for the People’s Republic of Bangladesh (Ministry of Water Resources and Bangladesh Water Development Board-BWDB) was launched for trial in 2019 and now it is fully operational. The system, which is computationally efficient and forecasts inundation at 30 m resolution, was co-designed and co-developed in close collaboration with engineers and hydrologists of BWDB. After a successful trial in 2019, BWDB is expected to adopt it within its operational infrastructure and offer the flashflood warning as a service to about 40 million affected citizens on a SASWE developed smartphone app called LIQUID EARTH. Flashfloods in the Northeastern region strike around the harvest time of March-April for Boro rice. Skillful flashflood forecasting as a service to millions of farmers is therefore expected to have a positive impact on the food security of Bangladesh by minimizing flashflood damage to Boro rice that accounts for the lion share of annual rice production Bangladesh.<br><b><a href="http://depts.washington.edu/saswe/flashflood/" class="link">Flash Flood Forecasting and Early Warning System Server</a></b></p>

									<a href="http://depts.washington.edu/saswe/jason3/" class="link"><h4>Dynamic Width Based Altimeter derived River Height Visualizer</h4></a>
									<p><span class="image left"><a href="http://depts.washington.edu/saswe/jason3/" class="link"><img src="images/Jason3.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>Dynamic width based river height visualizer was built to provide river height information derived from altimeter satellite. 
									To get the altimeter height along the rivers at 166 virtual stations over South and South-East Asia, two different types of altimeter height extraction are shown in near real-time. One is the conventional method (based on a static or fixed river with). The other is based on latest river condition that is inferred from the most recent Sentinel-1 SAR imagery.
									The SAR image helps identify the most likely river width around the time of the JASON-3 overpass, which is then used to extract height only over the track that has the highest confidence of having water. For rivers that frequently change in width and direction due to seasonal hydrology (monsoon) or human impacts (dams, barrages, diversions), such a SAR-based JASON-3 altimeter height extraction has been shown to improve JASON-3 height estimation accuracy for medium to large rivers (> 300 m). The analysis to infer latest river conditions is done in a cloud computing environment using Google Earth Engine, which makes the entire process very efficient and minimizes the need for downloading enormous amount of data. Our vision for the future is that such a system will cater to the strengths of the planned SWOT and NISAR missions, along with altimeters that will be flying by 2021, and rapidly provide users anywhere in the world, the best possible height estimate in near real-time to enable important decisions on the fly.<br><b><a href="https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/DataAction-2020-05-13-Altimeter-Height-Visualizer" class="link">Data in Action: A River Runs Through It - Observation and Management story published by JPL, NASA.</a><br><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2018.10.033">Remote Sensing of Environment Publication Link</a><br><a href="http://depts.washington.edu/saswe/jason3/" class="link">Jason 3 Height Visualizer Portal</a></b></p>

									<p><span class="image right"><a href="http://depts.washington.edu/saswe/saswms/" class="link"><img src="images/saswms.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>South Asian Surface Water Modelling system (SASWMS) was desinged to provide realtime information on water resources for the South Asian river basins (i.e., Ganges, Brahmaputra, Meghna, Indus and Mekong). It is a classic example of how the power of information technology can help to improve water resources monitoring in ungaged and data poor regions or the regions with transboundary conflicts. A realtime correction system was embedded to the SASWMS which crawls more than a dozen website of public agencies to get the in-situ precipitation data. This data was then being used by the SASWMS to improve satellite based measurements. It provides several water monitoring parameters which can be very useful in instant decision making and policy formulations when data inaccessibility happens due to the transboundary nature of rivers. <br><b><a href="https://iwaponline.com/jh/article/20/1/49/37884/A-scalable-open-source-web-analytic-framework-to">Open-source web-analytic framework publication link</a><br><a href="http://depts.washington.edu/saswe/saswms/" class="link">Link to SASWMS</a></b></p>
